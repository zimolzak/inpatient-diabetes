Why does sliding scale alone not make sense? Sugars are checked
pre-meal. If the pre-lunch sugar is 250, what does it mean? It means
maybe the patient ate a big breakfast and didn't have enough insulin
on board at breakfast to compensate---in other words it's an effect
of something that happened in the past. There is nothing you can do in
the present to change what happened in the past.

If you give insulin to this patient, things might go OK. If he eats
very little lunch, though, he might become
\emph{hypo}glycemic. High sugar pre-lunch means we \emph{should have}
given more insulin with breakfast.
